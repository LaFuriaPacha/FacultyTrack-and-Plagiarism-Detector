At Southeast, we believe you aren’t a spectator to your future. You apply all the grit and talent and sweat 
and passion you can muster because college is not the next step. It’s the biggest step. This is where you’ll try and fail and learn. 
Progress isn’t promised to anyone. It will be made by those with the courage to question. The hunger to know. And the will to do.
As a Southeast student, you’ll start building your resume almost as soon as you step foot on campus. The real-world opportunities begin on day one. 
That way, when you graduate from Southeast, you’ll be ready to excel in your career from day one, too.
Hands-on learning: that’s what we do.

It’s not just about what you can do on campus. Career counselors, internship coordinators, and faculty work to give students professional experience across the country. We help you gain experience, so when the real tests come, you’ll be ready.
FIND YOUR FLOCK
You’ll do that here.
Whether you live on campus or not, it’s easy to find the perfect balance of independence, entertainment, and support at Southeast. Our community offers a breadth of activities and teams, living spaces and dining options — each with its own unique vibe, so everyone feels at home.
You Have to Feel It

When we ask our students why they chose Southeast, they always say, "when I visited, I just fell in love." 
The best way to know if Southeast is right for you is to experience it for yourself. Whether you’re coming to campus for a tour or checking us out online, we’ll do our best to show you what your future could be like. We can’t wait to see you.
FACULTY SPOTLIGHT
VERA CAMPBELL JONES
I had been a hospital nurse for 30 years prior to coming to Southeast. I believe that’s important to the students because they know that their professor has had that hands-on experience.
